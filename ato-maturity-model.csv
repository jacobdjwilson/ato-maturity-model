Account Takeover (ATO) Maturity Model,,,
"This is a model which allows organizations to assess preventative capabilities of an account takeover. The intention of this model is to fit fraud techniques within a larger capability mapping such as software, cloud, or incident response.",,,
Domain,Capability,Activity,Description
1st / 2nd Party Fraud (valid account owner),Identify individuals or family members that knowingly misrepresent identities or provide false information,"Proactively identify mules, smurfs, and unsuspecting victims","Identify targets, victims, or fraudsters, classifying abuse cases and data points leading to a level of confidence. Correlate groups of users and assign a status such as suspected, observed, or confirmed."
,,Perform fraud review of platforms and services to identify operational flaws,Wholistically review the patterns of fraud to prioritize product engineering efforts and combat opportunities for fraudsters. Quantify the impact and qualify development efforts in terms of revenues. Operate a trust or fraud engineering team or champions within applicable engineering teams.
,,"Monitor transaction and account disputes, chargebacks, and non-sufficient funding events","Coordinate with merchant and payment processors to identify chargeback or friendly fraud. Leverage lessons in postmortem reviews to revise authorization of payments in physical, digital, and call based processing flows. Work with digital wallet providers and others to leverage fraud signals."
,,Identify metrics to measure the organization's ability to thwart repayment scams,"Track operational fraud rates in relation to transaction volumes. Understand the precision of detection and impact towards passwords/secrets, accounts, payment methods, and transaction disputes. "
3rd Party Fraud (new synthesized account),Limit new synthesized account creation using stolen information at scale,Monitor and contain coordinated scam efforts utilizing synthetic or stolen identities,"Enforce unique identity attributes and limits on reuse including geo location, device ids, and contact information. Prevent iterative fraud attempts and mass registrations in application logic and web application firewalls."
,,Use fraud decision systems to identify and prevent bots from performing sensitive actions ,"Rate limit sensitive application logic, shim links, enforce CAPTCHA mechanisms, and prohibit application or web crawlers. Enforce logic through fraud decision mechanisms and correlate high risk behaviors at initial access, sensitive action (order), and reconciliation (checkout) stages."
,,"Monitor and track the tactics, tools, and procedures of fraud rings and account takeovers ","Correlate the actions on objectives of known threat groups or fraud rings. Index the tactics, techniques, and procedures of adversaries. Create incident response playbooks and collaborate with industry peers for takedown efforts."
,,"Proactively contain and limit the use of stolen identities, payment methods, and PII ","Suspend or prohibit sensitive action of accounts which register with stolen or known fraudulent information. Establish and support banned, blocked, or suspended account states correlating to user account and group permissions."
,,Automate behavior and pattern recognition to alert and block known fraudulent patterns,"Automate fraud prevention patterns at authentication, account management, transaction, and processing touch points. Orchestrate self-service workflows for account re-enablement after a scam or non-first-party fraud event."
Account Takeovers (valid account owner lost control),Identify the transfer of ownership of account using stolen or synthetic identities,Utilize ATO indicators of compromise enriching user logs and behavior,"Correlate user behavior with known proxies, tor, and vps nodes. Leverage passive domain registrar and DNS intelligence. Assess the quality of data feeds and available context growing a fraud detection capability."
,,Protect password reset mechanisms through compromised email accounts ,"Enforce strict password strength requirements, establish verification / challenge workflows, prohibit sensitive actions following resets, and notify customers of changes out-of-band."
,,Actively monitor and thwart attempts to used compromised secrets,"Track the use of known leaked credentials, authentication tokens, API keys, or private certificates. Use automation to intelligently monitor, accept, challenge, and reject behaviors for account defense. Create and track incidents or cases related to groups of accounts and threat actors."
,,Prevent mobile carrier impersonation leading to SIM Swap for SMS 2FA,"Intelligently orchestrate MFA systems to proactively thwart weaknesses in business or operational logic. Leverage advanced ATO indicators including mobile carrier, vendor, and service supplier signals. Architect systems and processes for MFA compromise containment and incident escalation."
Scam Techniques (methods / techniques for perpetrating fraud),Track methods of carrying out sets of deceptive actions and techniques tied to human behavior,"Identify, track, and contain persuasion tricks or scams","Track exploitation of judgment. Through evidence collection, observations, and interviews with victims proactively identify gift or refund scams, give away scams, and fake support scams."
,,"Identify, track, and contain impersonation scams","Track exploitation of trust. Through evidence collection, observations, and interviews with victims proactively identify romance scams, investments scams, and position of power or enforcement scams."
,,Track victim fear toward safety and security,"Correlate the impacts of fraud on victims through threat of action based on personal security, employment, financial resources, health, and property."
,,Track victim appeal toward love and belonging,"Correlate the impacts of fraud on victims through actions based on friendship, intimacy, family, or personal relationship."
,,Track victim appeal or fear toward esteem and prestige,"Correlate the impacts of fraud on victims through actions based on embarrassment, lowering of status, weakening of strength, or restriction of freedoms. Additionally track the impacts of actions based on desire for increased respect, status, recognition or freedoms."
